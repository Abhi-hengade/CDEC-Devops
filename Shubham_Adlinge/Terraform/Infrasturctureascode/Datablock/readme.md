### Data Block:
- Data block is used to fetch and use existing data from infrastructure resources that are not managed directly by Terraform. 
- It allows you to read data without creating or modifying resources.
- Data blocks are useful when you need to reference existing resources or use dynamic values in your Terraform configurations.
